Added redux and set up store.
- npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
- npm install react-redux

Set up index.js main store and workoutSlice. Workout slice initial state are 3 empty arrays for push, legs and pull.

1.When user clicks on submit form after workout, get input and make post request to 'endpoint/push.json'
-collected set data and currentLoad data with refs. added workout name from props.data.name passed to ExerciseCard
-created const data with all combined data.
-used sendRequest of custom hook to make post request. 
-added addToPush dispatch method in workoutSlice that updates the push array after submission 
-before adding to array id is added to exercise object

correction:
- Currently only put request and get request is performed in the app. POST request is done externally in postman. 
- I'm manually adding workout data.
- Adding workout from scratch will be implemented later since its not needed for my scope and usecase
